Host Discovery: it is crucial phase to identify the live hosts on a network berfore exploitation.
Ping Sweeps:sending ICMP Echo requests to range of ip addresses to identify live hosts.
ARP Scanning: Using Address Resolution Protocol requests to identify hosts on a local newtwork. to find hosts in a same broadcast domain.
TCP SYN ping (half-open Scan): SEnding TCP SYN packets to a specify port to check if a host is alive.if it alive it responds with a TCP SYN-ACK.It stealthier than ICMP ping
UDP: Ping sending UDP packets for  those do not respond to icmp or TCP probes
TCP ACK Ping: send this request to a specific port.if port sends rest then host is live
syn-ack ping:send this paackets to a check host is alive


##important: if we use icmp echo on windows it wont reply.

fping -a -g <network id> 2>/dev/null tell us which ips are live

nmap scan -Pn -sA -p <ports> <ip>
to check wheter the system have firewall or not! if its filtered then its a firewall if not then there is no firewall.
for firewall Evasion and spoofing:
nmap -Pn -sS -sV -F <ip> to see  service version scanning
nmap -Pn -sS -sV -F -f <ip> //now the packets gett fragmented 
nmap -Pn -sS -sV -F -f -mtu <ip> //mtu is Maximum Transmitted unit


spoofing:
nmap -Pn -sS -sV -F -f -D <gatway-id> internal ip of the host
